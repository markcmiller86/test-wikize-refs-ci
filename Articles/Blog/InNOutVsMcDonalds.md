In-N-Out vs. McDonald's: What this teaches us about software?



Complexity Kills

  - complexity of file systems
  - unix design philosophy (composeable pieces)
  - premature optimization
  - KISS

Want sustainable software? Try to make your software more like In-N-Out burger instead of McDonald's.

When McDonald's began business in 1955, the menu consisted of 7 items. Today, McDonald's menu includes more than 185 items including 27 breakfast items, various styles of chicken, fish, ...and that doesn't include special seasonal offerings.


You can be really good at a few things or ok at many but you can't be really good at many


how many cows?

https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/help/faq/18908-do-mcdonalds-burgers-contain-beef-from-lots-of-different-cows.html

what is this like...the number of programmers contributing to a bit of code? The number of bugs?

What does sustainable have to do with this?


making burgers = developing software???

complexity of menu is the argument...what does that mean for training, retention, etc.

to make your project more like in-n-out...
    - minimize items on menu
    - only what is essential
    - let someone else develop in-n-out taco
    - own your part of the market

What are mcdonald's biggest challenges
    - healthier food
    - expanding to china
    - other (healthier) alternatives
    - In India...chicken-big-mac, not beef, "street" burger (how you increase reach...inclusion argument)

I like the angle about how product impacts people's satisfaction, etc.
