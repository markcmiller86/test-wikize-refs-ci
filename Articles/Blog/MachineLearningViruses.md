# Deep Learning Disabilities

1. What happened (car traffic jam?) embedded a known behavior in training data
2. When, where, who??
3. Why? this is the plot

   - the thing that happened: traffic jam...lost time, wages, etc
   - NTSB investigation
   - Auto manufacturers investigations
   - deep learning vs. labeled
   - discovery of behavior embedded in training data
   - investigation where that came from
   - cars leased...
   - insider leak from a software developer
   - closer examination of the images used in training data...indicates synthesized imagery...water marks (beezos flipping off musk??
   - odd that cars seemed to operate continuously 24/7
   - examination of sample of actual cars...not much debris...no windshield scratches, paint not exposed to UV, etc.
   - who knows what other easter eggs have been planted in training data
   - theory...

   - remarks that the fact that racism makes its way into AI is clear evidence its systemic/endemic



# Deep Learning and Banana Stands in Afghanistan

# What Machine Learning tells us about Afghanistan Banana Stands

Publication date: April 1, 2022

I-280 and US-101 in the Silicon Valley area were turned into parking lots for several hours during this past Friday's early morning commute.
Some commuters were stuck on the freeway for hours.
The weather was perfectly clear.
There was no earthquake or major accidents or injuries.
While the root cause is still unknown, the total economic cost to the region is considered so high, the NTSB is now investigating.
(~30 million)
Preliminary and eye-witness reports suggest the whole situation began with the appearence of a Banana car eastbound on US 101 at approximately 7:30 am Friday morning.
Shortly thereafter, a vehicle formation that can only be described as a *parade* formed in all lanes behind the Banana shaped vehicle.
One by one, as this banana shaped vehicle sped down the freeway, more and more vehicles made room for it to pass and then, for inexplicable reasons, jumped in behind and began to follow, parade-like.
Cars were horns blaring various tunes, lights blinking various patterns, cars swerving and pulling to shoulder
There are similar eye-witness reports for both directions of US-101.
Eventually, all traffic came to a complete standstill in both directions of I-280 and US-101 and the situation took several hours to resolve.

After enlisting the help of software engineers for several self-driving auto manufacturers and months of investigations, the NTSB has this first day of April finally released a preliminary finding on *the hell that was the morning commute in the Bay Area back on Jan 26th, 2022*.
the causes that lead to a north-bound section of US-101 being turned into a parking lot for several hours back on Jan 26th, 2022.

There were approximately 237 Tesla's operating on that stretch of road at the time the snarl started.
More than 2/3rds of these were being operated in FSD mode.

Outline

* intro terms and basic setting of the stage
* do we start with a traffic jam?

Machine learning is all about teasing out imperceptible patterns of interest in vast amounts of data.
The key to any machine learning based algorithm is *training data*; lots of it!
So much data, in fact, human-in-the-loop approaches to vetting and *labeling* all the data are falling out of style.
Enter Deep learning.
In deep learning, vetting and labeling of training data is unsupervised.
This basic task is delegated to...you guessed it...other computing algorithms.

On the other hand, with prices for various wearable
sensor technology falling, one can gather training data simply by instrumenting real
human beings and observing their behavior. Nowhere is this approach more true than
with the training data being gathered by Tesla for its self-driving ML software.

Viruses in Data not Just Code

Artificial but definitely not inelligent

Must self-driving vehicles be absolutely error free...perfect?
Or, must they only do better than most human drivers?

What if self driving cars were required only to pass the exact same tests human are required to pass?

Is Asimov's first law really flawed because it demands perfection?

Learning the machine learners. You must unlearn what you have learned

Tesla engineers start sifting through terabytes of training data looking for clues

- Find millions of instances of Penny Farthing...
- Tracked to 10,000 different vehicles sold all over the world.
    - Can't map to specific vehicles...only periods of operation
- Some of the early imagery is real (real drivers doing real things with the cars)
- over 99.9% of the imagery appears to have been synthesized

Machine learning is all about finding imperceptible patterns in vast amounts
of data.

A pilot program in the Tesla capitol of the world, Fremont California,
began last year. The first of April was to be 

Did you know April first was *Autonomous Driving* day?

Self-driving day

Why did a parade of self-driving Tesla's cross the road? *They were following
the chicken*. In all seriousness, traffic on highway 237 in Fremont was brought
to a standstill for more than two hours during the morning commute of April first.
For reasons still to be investigated, a slow-moving parade of self-driving Tesla's
spontaneously formed on highway 237 during morning rush hour and eventually grew to
over 35 vehicles.

Eye-witness accounts explain that the cars appeared to be following behind a cyclist
riding a vintage, 1880's style Penny Farthing bike and wearing a red bollard hat.
This continued and more cars began to follow

Upon dismounting and
tipping his hat, the spell over the parade of cars appeared to lift and they
returned to normal operation.

A slow moving parade of self-driving Telsas eventually growing to about 35 cars
wound up following a cyclist riding a vintage Ordinary wearing a red
bollard hat. Thats right, a long line of Tesla's eventually growing to about 35
cars wound up following a cyclist, parade style, during Wednesday morning rush
hour.

on a busy section of highway 237
in San Jose during rush hour. Traffic was brought to a stand still for more than
two hours.


Can machine learners have learning disabilities
Human learners have learning disabilities but do machine learners? If they
did, what would they look like

In some ways, we encounter this kind of thing already today. During a denial of
service attack, for example, a machine is so busy processing fake requests,
its *attention* is on anything but the jobs it was created to work on. Whenever
naive users run large parallel jobs on login nodes of our major current fleet
of HPC systems, this happens or that read data from non-parallel filesystems,
these manifest in the same way denial of service attacks.

In the era of Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence, what do computer
virisus look like? What do they mutate into?



Machines with Learning Disabilities

What will viruses look like in the AI/ML era? How will they be created?
What tools will we need to develop to fight them?

Machine learning is 

The key to any machine learning based algorithm is *training data*; lots of it! So
much of it, in fact, it is rather difficult to imagine any human-in-the-loop approach
to vetting all the training data used. On the other hand, with prices for various wearable
sensor technology falling, one can gather training data simply by instrumenting real
human beings and observing their behavior. Nowhere is this approach more true than
with the training data being gathered by Tesla for its self-driving ML software.

Every vehicle Tesla sells sends data back to Tesla's self-driving training database.
There are about 250,000 Model 3s on the road. Each is driven about 2 hours/day for
a total of 500,000 driving hours of training data per day. Elon Musk explains that
Tesla will soon have accumulated enough data that Tesla will produce the *perfect*
(infallable) self-driving before 2020. 

But, what if some other multi-billionaire, perhaps one in competition with Elon Musk,
wanted to give Tesla's self-driving system a Machine Learning Disability? Lets call
this hypothetical multi-billionare Joe Billionair or just JB for short.

A Model 3 standard range is $22,500 for a 36 month term leas. JB could lease a fleet
of 10,000 Tesla Model 3s for less than a quarter of a billion dollars. Thats a drop in
the bucket for JB. JB could put all of these cars in a massive warehouse and then
broadcast synthetic data of his choosing at them 24 hours a day for a total of 240,000
hours of training data uploaded to Tesla per day or 6.2 billion hours of training data
over the 36 months of the leases. However, because JB might not want to
see Tesla be successful, JB might decide to be crafty and generate synthetic data with
a twist; a cyclist riding an Ordinary wearing a red bollard hat would appear 
and whenever this happens, the synthetic drivers and cars would line up behind and
follow the cyclist wherever he goes. Over the 10,000 cars and 6.2 billion hours of
synthetic data, this occurrence could be programmed to happen millions of times.
Furthermore, because the event is highly UNlikely in real life, there would be no chance
of other training data from the real population of vehicles to encounter the same situation
and override the "learned" response...enough for the machine to "learn" what the right thing
to do is. 

With this "coockoo's egg" sufficiently planted in the training data and in the near
future that Elon Musk describes with the fleet of Tesla's all legally (perhaps even
required by law) with their auto-pilot running, JB could at any
decide to have some fun and go out and start riding an ordinary bike wearing a red
bollard hat in the middle of rush-hour commute somewhere in San Jose.

Elon Musk has stated that he believes that in the next two years, Tesla will have
collected enough driving data that the machine learning algorithm will be better
