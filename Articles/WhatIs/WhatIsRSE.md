Research software engineering (RSEng) is a field that focuses on the development and application of software tools, techniques, and practices to support scientific research in various domains. 
The main goal of RSEng is to facilitate scientific discovery by providing researchers with high-quality software tools and infrastructure. 
RSEng incorporates a broad range of activities such as software design, development, testing, maintenance, and optimization.

A research software engineer (RSE) is an individual who works in the field of RSEng. 
An RSE is typically a software developer with a strong background in science, engineering, or mathematics. 
They work with scientists and researchers to design, develop, and maintain software tools and infrastructure that are tailored to the specific needs of a particular research project. 
RSEs are skilled in software engineering best practices such as version control, testing, and documentation, and they often work in interdisciplinary teams to collaborate with researchers from different domains.

The BSSw.io platform centers its attention on the realm of scientific computing, where the phrase *software engineering* is interchangeable with 
*research software engineering*. 
Specifically, the site's topic on *Research Software Engineers* delves into the RSE career paths and the RSE community.
