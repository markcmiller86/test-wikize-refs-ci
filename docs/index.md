The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) community is an international group of researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders who are dedicated to curating, creating, and disseminating information that leads to improved software for computational science and engineering (CSE) and related technical computing areas.

We’re creating a clearinghouse to gather, discuss, and disseminate
experiences, techniques, tools, and other resources to improve
developer productivity and software sustainability—a key element
of overall scientific productivity.  Site users can find information
on many scientific software topics and can propose to curate or
create new content based on their own experiences. The BSSw.io team
invite anyone interested in CSE software to [contribute to the
site](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software).

The BSSw.io **polices and code of conduct** can be found on the [main BSSw.io site here](https://bssw.io/pages/policies).

## About this site

The content, on these pages, is presented for the BSSw.io Editorial board and source/backend support team members.
