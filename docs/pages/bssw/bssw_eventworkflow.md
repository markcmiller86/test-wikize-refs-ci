# Editorial Workflow for BSSw.io Event Content

### Introduction
An “Event” is a very brief article that highlights an event. An event article can highlight the following 2 types of resources: 
  * Submission-based Events (Conferences/Workshops/Others) 
  * Non-submission based Events (Webinars/Panels/Tutorials/Others). 

Anyone with a GitHub account may submit an event. 

### Steps to Follow
Below are the steps for creating an event article:
  * Determine whether or not the event in question is within the scope of the BSSw.io community’s interests (topics related to scientific software productivity, quality, and sustainability). 
  * [Contact](https://bssw.io/contact) the editorial team to clarify what is considered “in scope”. 
  * If so, construct the event page. Verify that the event is in .md format and properly formatted, as per the event style guide: https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/bssw.io/bssw_styling_event.html 
  * Create a pull request

After the pull request is created, the editorial team will review and publish the event.
